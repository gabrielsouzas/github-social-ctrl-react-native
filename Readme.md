## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Make sure you have the React Native environment configured on your machine. For more information, see [React Native - Getting Started](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started).

Or use Expo, see [Expo.dev](https://expo.dev/).

## üîß Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabrielsouzas/github-social-ctrl-react-native.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd github-social-ctrl-react-native
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash

Feel free to explore the corresponding code in the source files to understand the implementation details.

### 6. Publish

#### AAB

#### APK - Build APKs for Android Emulators and devices

1. Configuring a profile to build APKs

To generate an .apk, modify the eas.json by adding one of the following properties in a build profile:

- developmentClient to true (default)
- distribution to internal
- android.buildType to apk
- android.gradleCommand to :app:assembleRelease, :app:assembleDebug or any other gradle command that produces .apk

Example: eas.json

```json
{
  "build": {
    "preview": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      }
    },
    "preview2": {
      "android": {
        "gradleCommand": ":app:assembleRelease"
      }
    },
    "preview3": {
      "developmentClient": true
    },
    "preview4": {
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

2. Now you can run your build with the following command:

```shell
eas build -p android --profile preview
```

Remember that you can name the profile whatever you like. We named the profile preview. However, you can call it local, emulator, or whatever makes the most sense for you.

3. Download and install your APK in [Expo.dev](https://expo.dev/) or by the link provided at the end of the build

To install, transfer the APK file to a device or emulator. A device will be asked for permission for potentially dangerous applications, as it has not been verified by Play Protect (Play Store). The application will only be installed with this permission granted.
